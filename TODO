[x] Bug: Automove is great, but it can lead to a scenario where a card gets stuck between an empty cascade and a cell
[x] Update win cond to include empty cells. Or really full foundations

[x] #defect Allow move to cell and empty cascade

[x] #ux Maybe change it so "right-click" selects and left-click automoves?
[x] #ux Move "You win banner" so it's center-center and fits

[x] #mobile Improve look on smaller screens

[ ] #keyboard Enter = Action
[ ] #keyboard (Cmd+z | Delete) = Undo
[ ] #keyboard arrows = change focus

[x] #feature auto-complete
[ ] #feature detect if there are no valid moves and alert user
[ ] #feature highlight lowest ranking cards

[ ] #maybe #ux change CSS to have 4 constrained layouts: small (iPhone mini),
    small-wide, mobile (iPad), desktop.

[x] #improve Automoving a King from atop another card will check for empty cascades before cells


## Auto-complete

Find the smallest card of all cascades and cells.
If it can move to a Foundation, move it.
Repeat until there are no cards left.

If this is detected, auto-complete the game by "disabling input".
