TODO

[x] Move from cell
[x] Draw empty cascade
[x] Undo via clicking logo
[x] Winning game animation or banner or something
[x] Bug: Automove is great, but it can lead to a scenario where a card gets stuck between an empty cascade and a cell
[x] Update win cond to include empty cells. Or really full foundations

[x] #defect Allow move to cell and empty cascade

[x] #ux Maybe change it so "right-click" selects and left-click automoves?
[ ] #ux Move "You win banner" so it's center-center and fits

[x] #mobile Improve look on smaller screens

[ ] #keyboard Enter = Action
[ ] #keyboard (Cmd+z | Delete) = Undo
[ ] #keyboard arrows = change focus
